    "- In statistics, the <b>K-Nearest Neighbors</b> algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method (i.e., not based on parametrized families of probability distributions; common parameters are the mean and the variance). \n",
    "- In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its   neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.\n",
    "- It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection.\n",
    "- Since this algorithm relies on distance for classification, normalizing the training data can improve its accuracy dramatically."
